Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis &amp; Revenue Optimization
Objective:
Conducted a data-driven analysis of hotel booking cancellations to identify key factors affecting revenue loss and developed pricing and marketing strategies to improve booking retention and optimize hotel revenue.

Key Contributions & Impact:
Cancellation Rate & Revenue Impact Analysis:

Analyzed 120K+ hotel booking records (2015-2017) to identify patterns in cancellations vs. confirmed bookings.
Found that 37% of all bookings were canceled, leading to significant revenue loss.
Identified that cancellations resulted in vacant rooms for an average of 3-5 days, impacting operational efficiency.
Pricing vs. Cancellation Correlation:

Discovered that higher prices led to higher cancellations, confirming a strong correlation between Average Daily Rate (ADR) and cancellation rates.
Identified that resort hotels experienced higher cancellations than city hotels, likely due to premium pricing.
Found that cancellations peaked in January, suggesting a need for targeted marketing campaigns during off-peak months.
Customer Segmentation & Booking Source Analysis:

Determined that 46% of bookings came from online travel agencies (OTAs), followed by 27% from groups.
Found that Portugal had the highest number of cancellations, indicating a need for targeted retention strategies in that region.
Identified that only 4% of customers booked directly, presenting an opportunity to increase direct bookings through loyalty programs and promotions.
Strategic Business Recommendations:

Pricing Optimization: Suggested dynamic pricing strategies to adjust room rates based on demand, seasonality, and customer segmentation.
Targeted Discounts: Recommended weekend & holiday discounts for resort hotels to reduce cancellations and boost occupancy.
Marketing & Customer Engagement: Proposed January-specific marketing campaigns to counteract seasonal cancellation trends.
Service Quality Improvement in High-Cancellation Regions: Suggested enhanced service offerings in Portugal to reduce cancellation rates and improve customer satisfaction.
